Clean, simple filesystem abstraction for Go üóÉÔ∏è

![caution](./img/caution.png)

## Project Description

`fsx` is a minimal, simple filesystem abstraction for Go, allowing you to interact with a filesystem in a completely agnostic way whether it's the real OS filesystem, an in-memory filesystem for testing, or anything else!

It's inspired by projects like [spf13/afero], [C2FO/vfs] and [go-git/go-billy].

### So why another one?

Good question!

1. The alternatives don't *quite* do what I want (although [go-git/go-billy] is the closest)
2. They have additional features and functionality I don't need or want (like S3 support, fully qualified URIs etc.) or APIs that I don't think are optimal
3. I like building things ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it's the best way to really understand how something works

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/FollowTheProcess/fsx@latest
```
